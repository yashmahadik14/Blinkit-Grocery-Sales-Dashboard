##  Introduction

The Blinkit Groceries Sales Dashboard is an interactive Power BI project designed to provide actionable insights into the sales and performance metrics of a grocery platform. It consolidates data from various sources to offer a comprehensive view of total sales, item performance, outlet efficiency, and customer preferences. The dashboard enables data-driven decisions to optimize sales strategies, streamline operations, and enhance customer satisfaction.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**:
   - Data preprocessing techniques were applied to handle missing values, normalize variables, and ensure consistency in item categories, outlet tiers, and time series.

3. **Data Analysis**:
   - Key metrics such as total sales, average sales, outlet performance, and item-specific trends were calculated.
   - Relationships between outlet sizes, item types, and tier contributions were explored.

4. **Dashboard Development**:
   - Visualizations were created in Power BI to present trends, KPIs, and comparisons interactively.
   - Filters were added to allow users to slice and dice the data for deeper insights.
